OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project:Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset: Insights into Flower Species Characteristics

Project Objectives
1.	Understand the Dataset:
•	Familiarize yourself with the dataset structure and contents.
•	Understand the meaning and range of each feature:
1.	Sepal Length: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
2.	Sepal Width: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
3.	Petal Length: Length of the petal in centimeters.
4.	Petal Width: Width of the petal in centimeters.
•	Learn about the three species of iris flowers:
1.	Iris-setosa   
2.	Iris-versicolor
3.	Iris-virginica
2.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
•	Check for missing or inconsistent data values.
•	Handle duplicates or anomalies in the dataset.
3.	Statistical Analysis:
•	Summarize the data using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
•	Calculate statistical properties of each feature and their distributions across different species.
4.	Visualization Techniques:
•	Histograms: Analyze the distribution of individual features for each species.
•	Box Plots: Identify potential outliers in the data.
•	Scatter Plots: Examine relationships between pairs of features (e.g., petal length vs. petal width) to understand separability among species.
•	Heatmaps: Display the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical features.
•	Pair Plots: Visualize all possible pairwise combinations of features to explore interdependencies.
5.	Insights and Interpretations:
•	Identify which features are most important for distinguishing between the three species.
•	Observe patterns and trends, such as which species has the largest or smallest petals or sepals.
•	Highlight any correlations or linear separability between features for potential use in machine learning models.
6.	Documentation and Reporting:
•	Summarize all findings and visualizations in a well-organized report.
•	Include both statistical insights and visualization outputs to present a comprehensive analytics.
